# Using Graph Databases for Event Data

## Description
This repository collects queries for modeling, importing, and analyzing event data as Knowledge Graphs using the Labeled Property Graph data model of graph databases. All scripts and queries are licensed under LGPL v3.0, see LICENSE. Copyright information is provided within each Project.

## Projects
The following projects are part of this repository


### csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j
Data model and generic query templates for translating and integrating a set of related CSV event logs into single event graphs over multiple behavioral dimensions, stored as labeled property graph in [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/). See [csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j/readme.txt](csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j/readme.txt)
