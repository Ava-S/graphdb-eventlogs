	pip install neo4j
		OR
	conda install -c conda-forge neo4j-python-driver

Install Neo4j from https://neo4j.com/download/

Create a new graph database
- The scripts in this release assume password "12345678".
- The scripts assume the server to be available 
  at the default URL bolt://localhost:7687
- You can modify this also in the script.
- ensure to allocate enough memory to your database,
  advised: dbms.memory.heap.max_size=20G

Data and scripts provided
-------------------------

We provide data and script for 
- BPIC14
- BPIC15
- BPIC16
- BPIC17
- BPIC19

For each of the datasets, we provide

/.BPICXX/ - directory contains the original data in CSV format
            The datasets are available from:
            
            Esser, Stefan, & Fahland, Dirk. (2020). Event Data and Queries
            for Multi-Dimensional Event Data in the Neo4j Graph Database
            (Version 1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. 
            http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3865222

bpicXX_prepare.py - normalizes the original CSV data to an event table in CSV
                    format required for the import and stores the output in
                    the directory specified
                    in variable 'path_to_neo4j_import_directory'
                    (see "Configuration" below)

bpicXX_import.py - script to let Neo4J read the normalized event table of
                   BPICXX from CSV files in 'path_to_neo4j_import_directory' 
                   and executes several data modeling queries to construct
                   an event graph using 
                   - node types :Event, :Log, :Entity, :Class
                   - relationship types:
                     - :HAS (Log to Event, events recorded in a log),
                     - :CORR (Event to Entity, describing to which entities
                       an event is correlated), 
                     - :DF (directly-follows of events: temporal ordering of
                       event nodes per corelated entity)
                     - :OBSERVED (Event to Event Class, which class of
                       events was observed when the event occurred, 
                       e.g., which activity)
                     - :DF_C (aggregated directly-follows relation between
                       class nodes)
                     - :REL (Entity to Entity, which entities are structurally
                       related)

How to use
----------

For data import

1. start the Neo4j server
2. run bpicXX_prepare.py
3. run bpicXX_import.py


Examples of data querying
-------------------------

bpic17_queries_....py

Python scripts that query the graph of the BPIC17 dataset for properties and return GraphViz Dot visualizations of the quried graph.

- bpic17_queries_show_cases... assumes bpic17_import.py was run with
  - include_entities = ['Application','Workflow','Offer','Case_R','Case_AO','Case_AW','Case_WO']
  - option_DF_entity_type_in_label = True

- bpic17_queries_show_aggregated-df... assumes bpic17_import.py was run with
  - option_DF_entity_type_in_label = False
  - include_entities = ['Application','Workflow','Offer','Case_R','Case_AO','Case_AW','Case_WO','Case_AWO']
  - step_createDFC = True

bpic17_queries_...cypher.txt

Plain Cypher queries to query the BPIC17 graph for properties of the DF relationships.

        
Configuration
-------------

All configuration variables are set at the start of each script.                   

# Neo4j can import local files only from its own import directory, see https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/
# Neo4j's default configuration enables import from local file directory
#    if it is not enabled, change Neo4j'c configuration file: dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=true
# Neo4j's default import directory is <NEO4J_HOME>/import, 
#    to use this script
#    - EITHER change the variable path_to_neo4j_import_directory to <NEO4J_HOME>/import and move the input files to this directory
#    - OR set the import directory in Neo4j's configuration file: dbms.directories.import=
#    see https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/#query-load-csv-introduction

ensure to allocate enough memory to your database, advised: dbms.memory.heap.max_size=20G
